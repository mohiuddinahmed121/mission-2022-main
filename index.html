                    <p>From an evolutionary perspective the human mind's main goal is to keep you safe. Sometimes this
                        leads to self sabotage as it's just easier to stay in your comfort zone and avoid risk. However,
                        great things never come from mediocrity. Quit settling for average and strive for extraordinary.

                    <p>Stand tall and show the world what you are made of. When the world beats you down, find a reason
                        to get back up again. Never give up on success.
                        Try, try, try and try again. Feed your mind ideas of success, not failure.</p>

                    <p>Remember, the only way you can fail is if you give up. Every time you fail, you come one step
                        closer to success. You are not scared; you are courageous. You are not weak; you are powerful.
                        You are not ordinary, you are remarkable.Do not back down, do not give up.</p>

            <p>Persist and persuade others about your plans, as they are real. Nobody can do this but you. Nobody will
                get in the way of our dreams. Most people master the obvious; you are creating something that wasn't
                there before. It's bold, it's beautiful, and it's you. Give it your best, and your dreams will come to
                life. Success is yours.</p>
